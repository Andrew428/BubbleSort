# Bubble Sort
CS concepts showing the implimtaion of Bubble Sort in javascript.

Bubble sort is not a very efficient sorting algorithm that you would not want to use in a real world situation. 

It basically just scans through the array and every time it sees to elements out of order it will just swap them.  If you scan through the array enough times you will eventually have a sorted array. 

The BigO for a bubble sort is `O(n^2)`
